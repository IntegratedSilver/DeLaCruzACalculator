Challenge - Calculator
Starting a new project where we create a Calculator using the key fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JS
Person who Peer Reviewed me was Tony. 
Tony's Comment: For the most part I think the calculator looks good. Alejandro was giving himself a hard time saying it didn't look good. but on the contrary he went for an overall new design. Good work Alejandro! I really enjoyed the "BS" Button too xD
